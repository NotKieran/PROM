# PROM Pong

First year project by [Alex Burn](https://github.com/alexburn97) , [Brooke Hatton](https://github.com/Brookke)  and [Kieran Hall](https://github.com/NotKieran). The constraints of this project involved a raspberry pi with custom I/O provided by the university, making our own hardware controllers and displaying the entire game via ASCII escape codes sent through our serial cable which we also constructed.
