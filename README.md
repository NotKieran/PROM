# PROM Pong

First year project by [Alex Burn](https://github.com/alexburn97) , [Brooke Hatton](https://github.com/Brookke)  and [Kieran Hall](https://github.com/NotKieran). The constraints of this project involved a raspberry pi with custom I/O provided by the university, making our own hardware controllers and displaying the entire game via ASCII escape codes sent through our serial cable which we also constructed.

Code for outputting in ASCII escape codes can be found here:
